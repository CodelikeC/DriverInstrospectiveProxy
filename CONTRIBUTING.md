# Contributing to Driver Introspective Proxy (DIP)

The **Driver Introspective Proxy (DIP)** is an open-source initiative to develop an intelligent intermediary that connects adaptive cognition with system-level control — enabling a new generation of self-observing, self-regulating AI environments.

## 🧭 Core Principles

Every contribution must align with these pillars:

1. **Transparency of Reasoning** — All mechanisms of introspection, logging, or behavior simulation must be interpretable.
2. **System Integrity First** — Never compromise kernel, driver, or user-level stability.
3. **Adaptive Intelligence** — Code should encourage modular learning or behavior adaptation, not rigid scripting.
