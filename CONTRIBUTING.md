# Contributing to Driver Introspective Proxy (DIP)

The **Driver Introspective Proxy (DIP)** is an open-source initiative to develop an intelligent intermediary that connects adaptive cognition with system-level control ‚Äî enabling a new generation of self-observing, self-regulating AI environments.

---

## üß≠ Core Principles

Every contribution must align with these pillars:

1. **Transparency of Reasoning** ‚Äî All mechanisms of introspection, logging, or behavior simulation must be interpretable.
2. **System Integrity First** ‚Äî Never compromise kernel, driver, or user-level stability.
3. **Adaptive Intelligence** ‚Äî Code should encourage modular learning or behavior adaptation, not rigid scripting.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository and create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<module_name>
   ```
2. Follow the structure:
   /core/ ‚Äî main interfaces and introspective kernel logic

   /modules/ ‚Äî driver hooks, sandbox proxies, introspection analyzers

   /runtime/ ‚Äî execution, reflection, and rollback layers

   /docs/ ‚Äî all technical papers and design diagrams
   
3. Ensure all code adheres to:

   C++23 or Rust 1.80+

   Lua 5.4.x for lightweight runtime scripting

   Strict modular boundary (no hard-coded cross-module dependencies)

### Testing 
All PRs must include:

Unit tests for local functionality.

Introspective Simulation Tests to evaluate how modules respond to unexpected conditions.

Security regression tests for driver proxy and sandbox boundary.

``` bash
./scripts/run_all_tests.sh
```

### Code style 

- Follow Google C++ Style Guide.

- Rust: use cargo fmt and cargo clippy.

- Lua: use consistent indentation and naming reflecting its linked C++ module.

### üîí Security Policy

- DIP modules interface deeply with system-level drivers and introspection hooks ‚Äî contributions must:

- Avoid privileged escalation.

- Not access raw hardware or kernel APIs without sandbox wrapping.

- Declare any external dependency explicitly.
